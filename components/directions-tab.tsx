      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Unbox with Vigor:</strong> Place the main unit on a sturdy, level surface capable of supporting 150
          lbs of pure party potential.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attach the Spigot:</strong> Screw the industrial-grade spigot into the front receptacle. Hand-tighten,
          then give it a quarter-turn with a wrench. Do not overtighten.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Connect Power:</strong> Plug the heavy-duty power cord into a dedicated 20-amp circuit. Do not use
          extension cords. This beast is thirsty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fill the Hopper:</strong> Pour your margarita mix and tequila directly into the stainless steel
          hopper. Add ice. The machine craves ice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Engage Churn:</strong> Flip the large, satisfyingly-red switch to 'ON'. The internal auger will begin
          its glorious churn.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dispense & Enjoy:</strong> After 15-20 minutes, the mixture will reach optimal frozen consistency.
          Dispense via the spigot. Garnish with a salt rim and a sense of accomplishment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="text-3xl">Cleaning Protocol</h3>
      <p>
        Run a cycle with warm, soapy water. Follow with a sanitizing rinse. The stainless steel components are
        dishwasher safe. Refer to the manual for deep cleaning instructions.
